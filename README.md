# Microsoft Movie Analysis

This project explores what types of movies Microsoft should consider producing as it plans to launch a new film studio. The goal is to identify trends that drive box office success, such as genre, runtime, rating, and studio performance, using real-world data.

## Project Overview

Using publicly available movie data from IMDb and Box Office Mojo, we analyzed:

- What **genres** bring in the most revenue?
- How do **IMDb ratings** relate to box office success?
- What is the ideal **runtime** for a profitable movie?
- Which **studios** consistently produce hits, both critically and commercially?

The insights in this report can help Microsoft make data-informed decisions about what kinds of films to produce.
